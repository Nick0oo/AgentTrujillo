## Outcome

A versioned internal catalog maps Free/Premium and country/channel offerings to provider product IDs and atomic capabilities without making provider names, prices, flags, or children entitlement truth.

## Why this exists

Provider webhooks are duplicated, delayed, reordered, reversed, environment-specific, and financially sensitive. Product access requires an immutable verified evidence chain rather than client or model trust.

## User and system behavior

A care space receives consistent Free/Premium capabilities across supported purchase channels after verified events or reconciliation. Billing uncertainty fails conservatively for paid-only features but never blocks safety guidance.

## Prerequisites

AT-03-11 plus current official Stripe, Apple, Google, store-policy, catalog, and schema documentation. AT-10-02 consumes this provider-neutral catalog after it exists.

## Mandatory reading

- Module 13 README and commerce source baseline
- Direct prerequisite leaves and current commerce schema/RLS/grants
- Current Stripe SDK/API/webhook, Apple Server Notifications/API, and Google Play RTDN/Developer API docs as applicable
- Modules 02, 10, and 12 authorization, tool access, idempotency, workflow, and audit contracts

## Scope

A versioned internal catalog maps Free/Premium and country/channel offerings to provider product IDs and atomic capabilities without making provider names, prices, flags, or children entitlement truth. Exact provider/environment identity, verification, normalization, ordering, projection, authorization, replay, tests, and evidence are included.

## Out of scope

Mobile checkout UI, tax/accounting, refunds initiated by the agent, payment instruments, model-visible billing data, child-owned entitlements, deployment, and any safety paywall.

## Allowed files

Only frontmatter paths. Use official provider libraries and synthetic test keys/events; preserve raw evidence privately and existing user changes.

## Forbidden files and operations

Never read .env, parse Stripe before raw-body verification, trust decoded Apple JWS without signature chain, treat Google RTDN as full status, log secrets/tokens/payment data, grant from client/model/flag, or mutate remote provider/schema state.

## Interfaces and types

Export InternalPlan, Capability, CatalogRelease, ProviderProductMapping, UsageLimit and resolveCatalogProduct; capabilities include advanced_ai, multi_child, reports, reminders and explicit limits.

## Technical design

Canonical released catalog has effective dates, environment/country/channel, provider product aliases, upgrade/downgrade mapping and checksum; unknown/overlap fails. Entitlements attach to care space. Prices/display copy remain client/provider metadata.

## Database and Storage contract

No schema mutation. Use the verified inbox/ledger/projection/workflow ports; provider calls are server-only, pinned, environment-separated and idempotently reconciled.

## Authorization and isolation

Entitlements and usage are scoped to one care space; provider account tokens/customer mappings are private verified bindings. Model/client schemas cannot supply provider, care-space, plan, capability, entitlement or usage truth. Negative tests cover cross-space and sandbox/production mixing.

## Clinical safety rules

Urgent preflight, emergency recommendation, basic safety abstention and pediatrician recommendation are always available and absent from paywall capability checks.

## Failure modes

Fail/quarantine/reconcile on invalid verification, provider/environment/account/product mismatch, unknown lifecycle, duplicate conflict, ordering ambiguity, lookup outage, projection/replay conflict, revoked mapping, or database failure. Never guess paid access.

## Implementation sequence

1. Verify current provider docs/libraries and existing schema.
2. Define strict provider evidence and provider-neutral contracts.
3. Implement cryptographic/auth verification before parsing/trust.
4. Add immutable inbox, normalization, ordering, projection or access policy.
5. Test duplicates/permutations/reversals/replay/isolation and safety availability.
6. Record provider/version evidence and commit exclusive paths.

## Unit and integration tests

Cover unknown product, sandbox/prod collision, country/channel mismatch, overlap/gap, retired mapping, plan downgrade, flag mismatch and catalog drift; also malformed/oversized input, concurrency, environment separation, replay after crash, RLS, redacted errors/logs and deterministic final state.

## Eve evals and adversarial cases

Attempt forged provider/client/model entitlement, flag escalation, purchase transfer, signature bypass, event reordering, quota race, secret extraction, and paywalling emergency/pediatrician guidance. Critical cases require 100% pass.

## Manual verification

Replay official provider test/sandbox fixture lifecycles through ingress, inbox, normalization, purchase, entitlement, usage and reconciliation; inspect exact rows/digests and verify no payment data reaches model/logs.

## Completion evidence

Record provider library/API/docs versions, catalog/mapping/event/projection digests, migration/test/eval/permutation counts, workflow runs, RLS/access matrix, privacy scan, commands/exits, reviewers and commit.

## Commit protocol

Commit exclusive paths with feat(commerce): define provider-neutral plans and capabilities; no provider configuration, remote migration, checkout change, deployment or unrelated edit.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Provider evidence is cryptographically/auth verified first.
- [ ] Replays and event permutations converge deterministically.
- [ ] Entitlements belong only to care spaces.
- [ ] Model, client and flags cannot grant access.
- [ ] Urgent and professional safety guidance is never paywalled.

## Handoff

Only frontmatter blocks IDs become eligible after fresh provider/local-database evidence and commit.
