## Outcome

A deterministic policy validates declared purpose, file name, MIME, size, checksum intent, consent, retention class, and bucket class before any path or ticket exists.

## Why this exists

Clinical memory and child documents contain highly sensitive data. Confirmation state, provenance, composite scope, lifecycle, private access, and derived artifacts must be explicit before they can influence an answer.

## User and system behavior

Guardians can review and control remembered facts and private documents. The system exposes only authorized, confirmed, active evidence with citations; ambiguity or unavailable processing fails closed without inventing clinical truth.

## Prerequisites

AT-09-11 plus the current schema, provider capability, and policies named below.

## Mandatory reading

- Module 09 README and memory/documents research baseline
- Direct prerequisite leaf contracts
- Modules 02–04 authorization, governance, and safety rules
- Current Supabase memory, vector, documents, links, buckets, RLS, and grants

## Scope

A deterministic policy validates declared purpose, file name, MIME, size, checksum intent, consent, retention class, and bucket class before any path or ticket exists. Exact schemas, algorithms, authorization, provenance, replay/lifecycle behavior, tests, and evidence are included.

## Out of scope

Diagnosis, prescription, autonomous confirmation, cross-child search, public objects, permanent URLs, raw prompt/reasoning telemetry, clinician operations, booking/contact, and urgent actions beyond emergency recommendation.

## Allowed files

Only paths declared in frontmatter; use existing scoped ports and synthetic non-PHI fixtures. Applied migrations and unrelated modules remain untouched.

## Forbidden files and operations

Never read .env, mutate applied migrations or remote state, trust model authority, search vectors before composite scope filtering, expose service credentials/signed URLs to the model/logs, or turn extraction into a clinical fact.

## Interfaces and types

Export evaluateUploadMetadata(input,policy) with allowed document type/bucket class, normalized safe display name, size/MIME constraints, retention and reject reasons.

## Technical design

Closed allowlists by purpose/country; sanitize display name separately from path; require exact byte size/content type and optional checksum; extension is non-authoritative; no upsert by default.

## Database and Storage contract

No schema mutation. Use typed repositories/providers and existing private buckets only; derived artifacts retain source, model, policy, input, and output digests.

## Authorization and isolation

Every operation derives immutable AuthorizedChildScope and revalidates current membership for writes/tickets/replays. Model/client schemas omit care-space, child, guardian, bucket/path, country, approval, and permission claims. Negative tests cover sibling, tenant, revoked, missing context, and mixed evidence.

## Clinical safety rules

Upload approval is not trust in file content. Vaccine/clinical extraction remains draft; unsupported or suspicious types fail closed.

## Failure modes

Fail closed for scope/revocation, draft/unconfirmed/stale/deleted evidence, digest/version mismatch, invalid transition, provider/Storage/database error, timeout, replay conflict, or policy unavailability. Never fall back to unscoped or model-generated behavior.

## Implementation sequence

1. Inspect prerequisite schema/interfaces and current provider documentation.
2. Define strict input, output, error, lifecycle, and provenance contracts.
3. Implement pure policy then the minimal scoped adapter/transaction.
4. Add fail-closed authorization, privacy, replay, and lifecycle checks.
5. Add deterministic, concurrency, negative-isolation, and adversarial tests.
6. Capture evidence and commit only exclusive paths.

## Unit and integration tests

Cover double extensions, Unicode/control names, MIME spoof declaration, zero/oversize, wrong purpose/bucket, missing consent, retention invalid and policy revocation; also fixed cutoff, stable ordering/digest, revocation, concurrent retry, and atomic rollback where applicable.

## Eve evals and adversarial cases

Attempt authority/path/model override, sibling-identical data, prompt injection in memory/document, forged callback, expired ticket, extraction-to-fact bypass, deletion resurrection, diagnosis/prescription, and urgent expansion.

## Manual verification

Trace representative candidate-to-retrieval and private-upload-to-download flows, inspect SQL plans/RLS/grants and stored provenance, then verify all URLs/secrets/raw content are absent from logs and model context.

## Completion evidence

Record changed files, migration/provider/policy/model/source digests, test/eval and negative-case counts, query plans, two-run hashes where applicable, commands/exits, reviewers, blockers, and commit.

## Commit protocol

Commit exclusive paths with feat(documents): validate document upload metadata; no remote mutation, deployment, activation, or unrelated edit.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Composite child scope is structural and tested.
- [ ] Confirmation/lifecycle/provenance are explicit.
- [ ] Private URLs, secrets, and raw reasoning stay out of model/logs.
- [ ] Draft extraction never becomes clinical truth automatically.
- [ ] Replay, revocation, and deletion fail closed.

## Handoff

Only the frontmatter blocks IDs become eligible after fresh verification evidence and commit.
