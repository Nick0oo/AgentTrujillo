## Outcome

An authorized service reserves metadata/path then issues a one-purpose short-lived signed upload ticket for exactly one private object without upsert.

## Why this exists

Clinical memory and child documents contain highly sensitive data. Confirmation state, provenance, composite scope, lifecycle, private access, and derived artifacts must be explicit before they can influence an answer.

## User and system behavior

Guardians can review and control remembered facts and private documents. The system exposes only authorized, confirmed, active evidence with citations; ambiguity or unavailable processing fails closed without inventing clinical truth.

## Prerequisites

AT-09-12, AT-09-13 plus the current schema, provider capability, and policies named below.

## Mandatory reading

- Module 09 README and memory/documents research baseline
- Direct prerequisite leaf contracts
- Modules 02–04 authorization, governance, and safety rules
- Current Supabase memory, vector, documents, links, buckets, RLS, and grants

## Scope

An authorized service reserves metadata/path then issues a one-purpose short-lived signed upload ticket for exactly one private object without upsert. Exact schemas, algorithms, authorization, provenance, replay/lifecycle behavior, tests, and evidence are included.

## Out of scope

Diagnosis, prescription, autonomous confirmation, cross-child search, public objects, permanent URLs, raw prompt/reasoning telemetry, clinician operations, booking/contact, and urgent actions beyond emergency recommendation.

## Allowed files

Only paths declared in frontmatter; use existing scoped ports and synthetic non-PHI fixtures. Applied migrations and unrelated modules remain untouched.

## Forbidden files and operations

Never read .env, mutate applied migrations or remote state, trust model authority, search vectors before composite scope filtering, expose service credentials/signed URLs to the model/logs, or turn extraction into a clinical fact.

## Interfaces and types

Export PrivateUploadTicketService.issue(scope,input) and cancel; result contains document ID, opaque upload token/URL, required headers, exact size/MIME/checksum, expiry, and never service credentials.

## Technical design

Revalidate manage_documents permission; reserve first; request Supabase signed upload for exact path with upsert false; cap TTL below provider maximum; store nonce/ticket digest not URL; return once; cancellation marks reservation but cannot revoke an already issued URL, so TTL is minimal.

## Database and Storage contract

No schema mutation. Use typed repositories/providers and existing private buckets only; derived artifacts retain source, model, policy, input, and output digests.

## Authorization and isolation

Every operation derives immutable AuthorizedChildScope and revalidates current membership for writes/tickets/replays. Model/client schemas omit care-space, child, guardian, bucket/path, country, approval, and permission claims. Negative tests cover sibling, tenant, revoked, missing context, and mixed evidence.

## Clinical safety rules

Ticket grants upload only, not read/list/link/processing. It is never shown to the LLM or logged and cannot bypass bucket limits/scan.

## Failure modes

Fail closed for scope/revocation, draft/unconfirmed/stale/deleted evidence, digest/version mismatch, invalid transition, provider/Storage/database error, timeout, replay conflict, or policy unavailability. Never fall back to unscoped or model-generated behavior.

## Implementation sequence

1. Inspect prerequisite schema/interfaces and current provider documentation.
2. Define strict input, output, error, lifecycle, and provenance contracts.
3. Implement pure policy then the minimal scoped adapter/transaction.
4. Add fail-closed authorization, privacy, replay, and lifecycle checks.
5. Add deterministic, concurrency, negative-isolation, and adversarial tests.
6. Capture evidence and commit only exclusive paths.

## Unit and integration tests

Cover revoked permission, replay, provider failure after reservation, expired/cancelled ticket, URL logging, upsert attempt, wrong headers/body, cross-child request and orphan reconciliation; also fixed cutoff, stable ordering/digest, revocation, concurrent retry, and atomic rollback where applicable.

## Eve evals and adversarial cases

Attempt authority/path/model override, sibling-identical data, prompt injection in memory/document, forged callback, expired ticket, extraction-to-fact bypass, deletion resurrection, diagnosis/prescription, and urgent expansion.

## Manual verification

Trace representative candidate-to-retrieval and private-upload-to-download flows, inspect SQL plans/RLS/grants and stored provenance, then verify all URLs/secrets/raw content are absent from logs and model context.

## Completion evidence

Record changed files, migration/provider/policy/model/source digests, test/eval and negative-case counts, query plans, two-run hashes where applicable, commands/exits, reviewers, blockers, and commit.

## Commit protocol

Commit exclusive paths with feat(documents): issue short-lived private upload tickets; no remote mutation, deployment, activation, or unrelated edit.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Composite child scope is structural and tested.
- [ ] Confirmation/lifecycle/provenance are explicit.
- [ ] Private URLs, secrets, and raw reasoning stay out of model/logs.
- [ ] Draft extraction never becomes clinical truth automatically.
- [ ] Replay, revocation, and deletion fail closed.

## Handoff

Only the frontmatter blocks IDs become eligible after fresh verification evidence and commit.
