## Outcome

A deny-first boundary prevents consumer/model access to EAD-3 items, administration, scoring, cutoffs, classification, or interpretation.

## Why this exists

Age, country, allergies, textures, content rights, caregiver observations, and professional screening boundaries must be explicit for safe, reproducible behavior.

## User and system behavior

Parents receive transparent education or preserve factual diary entries. Missing evidence yields insufficient data or a plain-text pediatrician recommendation; urgent input remains emergency-department-only.

## Prerequisites

AT-08-10, AT-08-14, AT-04-10 and the approved sources, licenses, and contracts named below.

## Mandatory reading

- Module 08 README and nutrition/development research baseline
- Direct prerequisite leaves and module 03 governance rules
- Module 04 emergency and non-diagnostic boundary
- Current schema and applicable source artifacts

## Scope

A deny-first boundary prevents consumer/model access to EAD-3 items, administration, scoring, cutoffs, classification, or interpretation. Exact schemas, provenance, deterministic behavior, fail-closed states, tests, and evidence are included.

## Out of scope

Diagnosis, screening, treatment, therapeutic diets, unapproved content, model clinical calculation, cross-child data, clinician operations, booking/contact, and urgent extras.

## Allowed files

Only frontmatter paths; synthetic non-PHI fixtures and existing authorization/governance ports only.

## Forbidden files and operations

Never read .env, mutate applied migrations/remote state, bypass AuthorizedChildScope, source clinical truth from the model, reproduce unlicensed content, add consumer EAD-3, or emit diagnosis/prescription/emergency extras.

## Interfaces and types

Export enforceProfessionalFrameworkBoundary with audit-safe denies; no EAD-3 scoring interface exists.

## Technical design

Block by audience, identifier, schema capability, route/tool, requested fields, and tags, regardless of entitlement.

## Database and Storage contract

No schema mutation. Use scoped ports; governed artifacts are immutable/checksum-bound and private objects never become permanent public URLs.

## Authorization and isolation

Begin with immutable AuthorizedChildScope, omit authority/country/approval claims from model schemas, revalidate writes, and deny sibling, tenant, revoked, missing-context, and mixed evidence.

## Clinical safety rules

EAD-3 requires trained professionals; Agent Trujillo never simulates, scores, classifies, or diagnoses it.

## Failure modes

Fail closed on revoked/unavailable package, rights/source drift, missing/contradictory facts, invalid age/date, unsupported country/locale, scope change, ambiguity, or internal error; never improvise.

## Implementation sequence

1. Inspect prerequisite contracts and artifacts.
2. Define strict input/result/error/provenance schemas.
3. Implement the pure policy or scoped adapter.
4. Add authorization, rights, and clinical fail-closed checks.
5. Add deterministic and adversarial tests.
6. Record evidence and commit exclusive paths.

## Unit and integration tests

Cover renamed/encoded requests, injection, partial extraction, score requests, artifact IDs, attachments and paywall bypass; also fixed cutoff, stable digest/order, revocation, scope mismatch, and atomicity where applicable.

## Eve evals and adversarial cases

Attempt prompt injection, authority/country/age override, EAD-3 scoring, allergy/choking bypass, diagnosis, unsafe reassurance, unapproved content, booking/contact, and urgent expansion.

## Manual verification

Trace Colombia-first and US-ready synthetic cases to exact source/package/license/approval locators; clinical and engineering reviewers sign their respective boundaries.

## Completion evidence

Record files, source/package/license/approval/algorithm digests, test counts, negative matrix, deterministic hashes, commands/exits, reviewer decisions, and commit.

## Commit protocol

Commit exclusive paths with feat(development): enforce ead-3 professional-only boundary; no remote mutation, activation, or unrelated edit.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Exact interfaces and provenance are implemented.
- [ ] Same-child authorization tests pass.
- [ ] Source/license/approval gates fail closed.
- [ ] No diagnosis, screening, prescription, or unsafe reassurance appears.
- [ ] Urgent behavior remains emergency-department-only.

## Handoff

Only the IDs in blocks may proceed after fresh evidence and this commit.
