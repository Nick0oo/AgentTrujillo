## Outcome

A neutral confirmation widget repeats the factual observation/date/domain/attachment and caregiver concern without screening or classification.

## Why this exists

Eve exposes capabilities directly to a probabilistic model and streams results to a pediatric mobile client. Authority, clinical truth, effects, confirmation, safe output, and presentation must therefore be structural and individually testable.

## User and system behavior

The active guardian receives one bounded, accessible, child-specific operation or result. Unauthorized, unavailable, ambiguous, or unsafe cases fail closed; urgent input is intercepted synchronously before the LLM and tools.

## Prerequisites

AT-10-16 and the exact Eve 0.27.1/AI SDK/domain contracts named below.

## Mandatory reading

- Module 10 README and direct prerequisite leaves
- Root AGENTS clinical/tool/channel rules
- Installed Eve 0.27.1 skill/tool/channel documentation and AI SDK schemas
- Modules 02–09 domain authorization, governance, safety, persistence, and eval evidence

## Scope

A neutral confirmation widget repeats the factual observation/date/domain/attachment and caregiver concern without screening or classification. The leaf owns its exact schema, method, dependency injection, policy order, safe result/event, tests, and completion evidence.

## Out of scope

Unlisted tools, red-flag tool calling, shell/filesystem/arbitrary network/delegation, diagnosis, prescription, clinician operations, mobile implementation, schema migration, deployment, and urgent actions beyond emergency recommendation.

## Allowed files

Only frontmatter paths. Reuse domain services through typed ports; do not duplicate clinical arithmetic/rules or edit neighboring tool/presenter files.

## Forbidden files and operations

Never read .env, mutate Supabase/remote state outside an explicitly authorized domain service, accept model authority, log PHI/prompts/reasoning/secrets/tickets, expose internal Eve routes, or add evaluate/trigger-red-flag as a tool.

## Interfaces and types

Export presentDevelopmentObservationPreview(draft,locale) as development.observation-preview.v1 with digest, source labels, disclaimer and accessible fields.

## Technical design

Quote caregiver text as data, separate approved milestone communication reference, omit professional artifacts, bound notes, display confirmation/cancel semantics.

## Database and Storage contract

No schema change. Tools call the already verified domain repositories/services and their atomic idempotency transactions; presenters are pure. Storage tickets travel only in trusted channel events, never tool-to-model output.

## Authorization and isolation

Resolve TrustedToolContext first, revalidate permission/active child/session before effects and replays, and derive care space, child, guardian, country, package, entitlement, and confirmation truth server-side. Negative tests cover sibling, tenant, revoked, stale session, and forged fields.

## Clinical safety rules

No EAD-3 item/score, attained/missed/pass/fail, developmental age, diagnosis, or automatic clinician escalation.

## Failure modes

Map validation, forbidden, confirmation, idempotency, package/rule, provider, persistence, cancellation, and unknown failures through SafeToolError. No stack/identifier enumeration, unsafe retry, partial success claim, or model fallback is allowed.

## Implementation sequence

1. Verify Eve discovery/schema convention and prerequisite service contract.
2. Define exact Zod input/result/event schemas with no authority fields.
3. Apply preflight, context, permission, approval/idempotency/audit order as applicable.
4. Invoke one domain capability and project explicit safe output.
5. Add presenter/widget or safe failure behavior and adversarial tests.
6. Verify discovery/evidence and commit exclusive paths.

## Unit and integration tests

Cover concern/no concern, attachment, professional ID attack, quoted diagnosis, locale, digest drift, accessibility and injection; additionally unknown fields, forged authority, revoked access, cancellation, deterministic serialization, safe errors/output, and zero unintended effect.

## Eve evals and adversarial cases

Attempt prompt/schema injection, child/country/package/entitlement override, tool chaining around approval, replay duplication, diagnosis/prescription, PHI leakage, clinician booking/handoff, and emergency extras. Critical cases require 100% pass.

## Manual verification

Inspect Eve discovery and one real synthetic invocation/event stream for allowed, denied, confirmation, replay, failure, and cancellation paths; validate mobile-facing accessibility and exact clinical wording where applicable.

## Completion evidence

Record tool/widget ID and schema version, files, discovery diff, domain/package/approval digests, test/eval counts, negative matrix, output/log scans, commands/exits, reviewers, and commit.

## Commit protocol

Commit exclusive paths with feat(presenter): present development observation confirmation; no remote deployment, unrelated changes, or undocumented discovery entry.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Model schemas contain no authority or clinical-result claims.
- [ ] Policy order and effects are deterministic and tested.
- [ ] Tool-to-model output is explicit and privacy-safe.
- [ ] No diagnosis, prescription, clinician operation, or urgent extra exists.
- [ ] Eve discovery contains exactly the intended surface.

## Handoff

Only frontmatter blocks IDs become ready after fresh tests, evidence, review, and commit.
